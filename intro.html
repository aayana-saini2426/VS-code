<p><h1> Today I'll be writing a paragraph on myself</h1>
<p> Hi, i am Aayana
    I like to read books
    I've currently read <q><b> The Reappearence of Rachel Price</b></q> followed by <q><b> A ggod girl's guide to murder</b></q>
    I will work hard to buy more books and create a bookshelf for myself 
    I will explore other genres as well but currently my favourite genre is <b> murder, mystery, crime and thriller.</b>
    I also enjoyed reading a book called <q> <b> Divine Rivals</b></q> by <q><b> Rebbecca Ross</b></q>
    My favourite author till now is <b> Holly Jackson</b>. <mark>She not only creates a thriller and mystery story but she also amazes me with her writing and definitions of a particular scene</mark>
