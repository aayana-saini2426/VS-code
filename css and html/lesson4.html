    <p> A novel is a piece of long narrative in literary prose. Narrative prose is meant to entertain and tell a story. It is a
    description of a chain of events which includes a cast of characters, a setting, and an ending. Most publishers prefer
    novels that are in the 80,000- to 120,000-word range, depending on the genre.</p>

        Genre novels must adhere to the styles, and conventions of their category in order to meet readersâ€™ expectations. For
        example, readers of mysteries assume any novel in that genre will start with a crime or threat of a crime, provide clues
        and possible motives throughout the story, and conclude with a resolution of the problem, i.e., the criminal being
        brought to justice, or the evil plan being thwarted.
